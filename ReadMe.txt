This is my Rise of the AI assignment


You play as Yamcha as he tries to defeat the saibamen. You control his attack, the Sokidan, with the arrow keys. Crash it into the enemies!
You control Yamcha with the A and D keys to rotate and the space bar to move forward. Don't let the enemies touch him!
Yamcha will also die if he leaves the screen so be careful controlling him.

There are three enemy types. 
The first jumps up and down on the platform
The second zips from left to right
The third will slowly follow Yamcha.

Enjoy!
